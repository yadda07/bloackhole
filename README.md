Dynamic Database Auditing and Recovery: A Scalable Solution :
This methodology introduces a schema-independent approach to database auditing, designed for flexibility, scalability, and simplicity in managing data changes across complex systems.

Why It Matters ?
The solutions V1 often tie recovery processes to a single schema, limiting their adaptability. This approach removes that restriction, enabling transaction logging across multiple schemas with just one reusable function.

How It Works ?
1. Centralized Functionality: A single function, recover_json, handles transaction logging (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for any schema.
2. Dynamic Schema Handling: The function dynamically identifies the target schema and table, making it applicable across the entire database.
3. Metadata-Driven Logging: Each transaction captures rich metadata (operation type, old and new values, timestamps, and user info) and stores it in JSONB format for efficiency.

Key Benefits
Scalability: One solution works for multiple schemas, reducing duplication and simplifying maintenance.
Error Recovery: Quickly restore or audit changes with a detailed, reliable log of all transactions.
Simplicity: A straightforward trigger system ensures the function activates only when needed, minimizing overhead.
